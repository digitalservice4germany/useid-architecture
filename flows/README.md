## UseID Identification flows

* The ["Magnus" flow](magnus-flow-mobile.md) depicts the flow which applies for customers who already have an existing eID integration. 
This flow only works on mobile devices. For considerations of a flow including a device switch see `research/device-switch`.
* The ["Paula" flow](paula-flow-mobile.md) depicts the flow for customers without eID integration using a simplified API provided by the UseID Backend Service. 
This flow only works on mobile devices. For considerations of a flow including a device switch see `research/device-switch`.
